# OOP: SVG Logo Maker

## Description
### What was your motivation?
- The motivation behind building this Node.js command-line application was to provide freelance web developers with a simple tool to generate logos for their projects without needing to rely on graphic designers or specialized software. 

### Why did you build this project? 
- The project was built to address the common need among freelance web developers for simple logo creation. Many developers may not have the design skills or resources to create logos themselves or hire a professional designer for every project. By developing a command-line tool, developers can streamline the logo creation process and maintain creative control over their projects.

### What problem does it solve?
- This project solves the problem of logo creation for freelance web developers who may lack design skills or access to professional design tools. By offering a command-line interface for logo generation, developers can quickly input text, select colors, and choose shapes to create customized logos tailored to their projects. This tool simplifies the logo creation process and empowers developers to maintain branding consistency across their work.

### What did you learn?
- Through this project, I learned about working with user input in a Node.js command-line application, handling file operations to save generated content, and interacting with SVG file formats. 

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository from the source where it's hosted, such as GitHub. Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate into the directory of the cloned repository.
3. Once you're inside the project directory, install the dependencies required for the application to run. Run the command: `npm install`.

## Usage

1. Follow the prompts: Once the application is running, it will prompt you for input regarding the text, text color, shape, and shape color for the logo generation. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information as requested.
2. After providing all the required input, the application will generate an SVG file named `logo.svg` in the project directory.
3. You can open the generated `logo.svg` file in a web browser to verify that the logo meets the specified criteria, including the dimensions and appearance based on the input provided during the execution of the application.
